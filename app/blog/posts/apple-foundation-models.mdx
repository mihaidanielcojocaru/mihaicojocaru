Apple has introduced the **Foundation Models framework**, a powerful new toolset that allows developers to integrate on-device large language models directly into their iOS and macOS applications. This framework is the engine behind **Apple Intelligence**, enabling features that are both smart and privacy-preserving.

## What are Apple Foundation Models?

The Foundation Models framework provides access to Apple's own 3-billion-parameter language model. Unlike cloud-based solutions, this model runs entirely on your device. This approach offers significant benefits:

*   **Privacy First:** Your data never leaves your device.
*   **Zero Cost:** No recurring API fees for cloud processing.
*   **Offline Capable:** Works without an internet connection.
*   **Low Latency:** Immediate responses without network round-trips.

## Getting Started

The framework is deeply integrated with Swift, making it incredibly easy to use. The core class you'll interact with is `LanguageModelSession`.

### Checking Availability

Before using the model, you should check if it's available on the user's device. This requires the device to support Apple Intelligence.

```swift
import FoundationModels

if SystemLanguageModel.default.isAvailable {
    print("Foundation Models are ready to go!")
} else {
    print("This device does not support Foundation Models.")
}
```

### Basic Text Generation

Generating text is straightforward. You create a session and simply ask for a response.

```swift
let session = try LanguageModelSession(model: .system)
let response = try await session.generate("Explain the concept of 'recursion' in programming.")
print(response)
```

## Advanced Features: Guided Generation

One of the most powerful features is **Guided Generation**. Instead of parsing raw string output, you can ask the model to generate structured data that matches your Swift types.

```swift
import FoundationModels

@Generable
struct Recipe {
    let title: String
    let ingredients: [String]
    let steps: [String]
}

let session = try LanguageModelSession(model: .system)
let recipe: Recipe = try await session.generate("Create a simple pancake recipe.")
```

Using `@Generable` and `@Guide` macros, the framework ensures the model's output conforms perfectly to your struct, eliminating the need for complex prompt engineering and JSON parsing.

## Implemented in Rider Weather

I have already started leveraging these capabilities in my own projects. In **[Rider Weather](/projects/rider-weather)**, I'm exploring ways to use on-device intelligence to provide even more personalized weather summaries and riding advice based on complex local conditions.



## What's Next?

I have many more ideas for implementing Apple Foundation Models across my apps. The potential for "Tool Calling"—where the model can intelligently invoke functions within your app—opens up a new world of possibilities for natural language interfaces.

Stay tuned for more updates as I dive deeper into building with Apple Intelligence!
