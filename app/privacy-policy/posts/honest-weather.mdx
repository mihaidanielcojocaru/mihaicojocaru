# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** December 7, 2025

**Honest Weather** ("we", "us", or "our") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and handle your information when you use our mobile application ("the App").

## 1. Information We Collect
Honest Weather is designed to be privacy-first. We do not collect, store, or share any personal information.

### 1.1. Location Data
*   **What we use it for:** The App requires access to your location to provide accurate, hyper-local weather forecasts.
*   **How it is handled:** Your location data is processed locally on your device and sent directly to Apple's WeatherKit service to retrieve weather data. We do not store, track, or share your location history on our servers. You can revoke location access at any time in your device settings.

### 1.2. Usage Data
*   **What we allow:** The App does not collect usage data or analytics. We do not track how you use the app.

## 2. Third-Party Services
We rely on third-party services to provide core functionality.

### 2.1. Apple WeatherKit
*   We use Apple's WeatherKit to provide weather data.
*   Your location data is sent to Apple to fetch forecasts. Apple's handling of this data is governed by their privacy policy.
*   [Apple Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/)

## 3. Data Security
Because we do not collect personal data, there is no personal data for us to secure or lose. Your location data remains on your device and is only shared with Apple WeatherKit for the purpose of fetching weather.

## 4. Children’s Privacy
The App is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.
