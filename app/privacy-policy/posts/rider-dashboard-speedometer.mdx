# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: January 14, 2026**

## Introduction

Rider Dashboard: Speedometer ("the App") is developed by Mihai Daniel Cojocaru. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use the App.

## Information We Collect

### Location Data
The App uses your device's location to calculate speed, acceleration, distance, and GPS accuracy. Location data is processed on your device and is not stored on our servers.

### Trip & Performance Data
Trip distance, acceleration times, top speed, and related metrics are stored locally on your device so you can review and reset them.

### App Settings
Preferences such as units (km/h or mph) and tracking options are stored locally on your device.

## How We Use Information

We use the data above solely to provide real-time dashboard metrics, trip tracking, and the settings you choose. We do not use your data for advertising or profiling.

## Data Sharing

We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties. The App does not integrate third-party analytics or advertising SDKs.

## Background Location

If you enable background recording, the App may access location data while in the background to continue tracking your trip. You can disable this at any time in iOS Settings.

## Data Storage & Security

All App data is stored locally on your device. We do not operate external servers for storing your personal data. Your data is protected by your device's built-in security features.

## Your Choices

- You can revoke location access or background location access in iOS Settings.
- You can reset trip data from within the App.
- You can delete all App data by uninstalling the App.

## Children's Privacy

The App is not intended for children under 17. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected in the "Last updated" date above.
